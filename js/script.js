// Here is a random take-home challenge:
// Create a mini Car Dealership using classes 
// You need to extend a class at least once
// Use getter and setters
// Incorporate destructuring arrays and objects and template literals
// And outside of classes try at least one arrow function that does something
// You're free to be as creative as you like
// Please send over your work via DM on Slack. You can use a GitHub repo or you can 
// send a snippet. Up to you! Have fun! I can't wait to see what you do :D Thank you!
